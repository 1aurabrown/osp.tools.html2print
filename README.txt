HTML 2 print
============

This little tool is a boilerplate, a minimal example to start a print project using HTML, less/CSS and Javascript/Jquery to design it.

You can't use less.js on a local file (URL starting with "file:///"). 
To bypass this limitation, you can run a simple webserver with python. 
To do so:

- Open a terminal.
- Run those sommands:

    cd /path/to/this/directory/
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

- Visit the URL "http://localhost:8000/"!
