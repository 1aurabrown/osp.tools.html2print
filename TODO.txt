- Table of contents (Internal links works with anchors; use Jquery to make a
  table of content / or use a jquery plugin to do so?)
- pagination inside page
- pagination total (page 1/16, etc.)
- CMYK color split with Ghostscript
- multiple image sources
- check image resolution
- put objects on spreads (as a jquery plugin, it would duplicate the object on
  the next page with an offset of "width and margin-left")
- css columns â†’ doesn't print as columns, we have to do css regions instead.
  can we make a javascript to do so? as it is much shorter to write it in css?

- .moveable elements widen page width if outside the page.
- .spread doesn't work with .moveable elements (need to shift their position)
- when printing with .spread, javascript to remove the .spread class
- crop marks are slightly shifted, it's obvious after a certain number of
  pages
- View as spread (quite buggy when using absolute elements, also to export the PDF, you need to switch to single-page view)
