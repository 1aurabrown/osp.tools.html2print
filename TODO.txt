- crop marks: higher page format
- add margins around pages on screen-only + background color
- choice to give a page number or to calculate it automatically
- Table of contents (Internal links works with anchors; use Jquery to make a
  table of content / or use a jquery plugin to do so?)
- spot colors export in different PDFs with export class
- put objects on spreads (as a jquery plugin, it would duplicate the object on
  the next page with an offset of "width and margin-left")
- css columns â†’ doesn't print as columns, we have to do css regions instead.
  can we make a javascript to do so? as it is much shorter to write it in css?
